#Room Description
Ice
  
Deploy & hack into a Windows machine, exploiting a very poorly secured media server.

# Questions/Tasks

#1 
Deploy the machine! This may take up to three minutes to start.

No answer needed

#2	
Launch a scan against our target machine, I recommend using a SYN scan set to scan all ports on the machine. The scan command will be provided as a hint, however, it's recommended to complete the room 'RP: Nmap' prior to this room.

- Note: Ran db_nmap 'BOX IP ADDRESS' and got following results:
msf5 exploit(windows/http/icecast_header) > set RHOST 10.10.171.143
RHOST => 10.10.171.143
msf5 exploit(windows/http/icecast_header) > db_nmap -sV 10.10.171.143

Once the scan completes, we'll see a number of interesting ports open on this machine. As you might have guessed, the firewall has been disabled (with the service completely shutdown), leaving very little to protect this machine. One of the more interesting ports that is open is Microsoft Remote Desktop (MSRDP). What port is this open on?

- Note: while it is a MSRDP the actual listing was 3389/tcp  open  tcpwrapped

3389 

#4	
What service did nmap identify as running on port 8000? (First word of this service)

icecast

#5	
What does Nmap identify as the hostname of the machine? (All caps for the answer)

DARK-PC
